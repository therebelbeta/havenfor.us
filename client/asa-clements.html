    <p>I am friend of the fiend a mother efffing dance machine... Wait that's Trued. 
      In reality I am cool, calm, fairly collected and at times aloof. I like people, 
      they make me happy. I think I make them happy. Life is good. I have a beautiful
      wife that makes life rich and beautiful; full of hope.</p>
    
    <p>These same qualities I have seen in the relationship that Trent and Emily have. 
      I've known Trent for a year. He is kind, considerate, passionate and extremely 
      intelligent. Perhaps his best quality is that he encourages others to be the same. 
      It's an honor to call him a friend and for him to consider me one as well.</p>
